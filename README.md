# HollowKnight.ReopenCityDoor

Mod that reopens the door between the City of Tears elevator room and Fungal Wastes (above Elder Hu). The door being open can be toggled in the mod menu.

With Randomizer installed, can be configured in the Connections menu to:

* Disabled - Randomizer will behave as if this mod is not installed (and the door will be open if the mod menu setting is open).
* Open - Randomizer will behave as if the transition is always open, and the gate will be unlocked from the start.
* Unlockable - the gate will be closed initially, but will be opened upon finding a special key placed in the items pool.
* Define Refs - the same as Disabled, except the randomizer will be informed that the transition and key item exist (for use with the custom pool injector).

In the Open and Unlockable modes and with transitions randomized, the gate transition will be added to the main transition group.
